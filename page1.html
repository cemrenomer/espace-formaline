<h3>ABOUT</h3>
<p>Espace Formaline is an artist-run space that brings art into everyday life in an accessible way. Found on Gränicherstrasse in Suhr, next to the train station, Formaline is made up of 17 “Schaukasten” (display cases) built into a wall. These cases turn a busy spot—where cars often line up in traffic and trains pass by—into an outdoor art gallery that anyone can enjoy, whether they planned to or just happen to be there.</p>
<p>The name “Formaline” has two meanings. First, it plays on the phrase “form a line,” inspired by the constant traffic nearby. The drivers stuck in their cars or passengers on passing trains or pedestrians heading to the train station naturally end up looking at the art, making it part of their routine. Second, it refers to the chemical “formaline,” used commonly to preserve the deceased. This ties into the mission of the space, to “preserve” and showcase art from both local and international artists.</p>
